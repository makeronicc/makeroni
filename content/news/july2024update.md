Tomorrow, the 28th, will be the latest of our in person meetups and we are very much in physical mode now. The Discord server is still up and running and helping coordinate physical events, including non-Makeroni things like EMF and Liverpool Makerfest visits. So, if you want to sync up and stay in the loop, the Discord server is the place to be. Click on the Discord space invader in the top right to get invited onto the Makeroni server straight away.

We've tidied up the site and added some enhancements too. The new Meetings tab will take you to an autoupdated list of upcoming meetings.
