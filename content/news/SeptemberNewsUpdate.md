We have a new way to say you are coming to a HackWimbledon event. We are switching to [Lu.ma](https://lu.ma) for event tickets (yes its still free). Our old Meetup space is being closed down due to it costing even more than ever. You can find the future meetings on [the HackWimbledon calendar](https://lu.ma/hackwimbledon) at the nattily URL'd `https://lu.ma/hackwimbledon`.

The Discord server is also still up and running and helping coordinate physical events, including non-Makeroni things like EMF and Liverpool Makerfest visits. So, if you want to sync up and stay in the loop, the Discord server is the place to be. Click on the Discord space invader in the top right to get invited onto the Makeroni server straight away.

The autoupdated list of meetings has gone away but the lu.ma calendar looks like it'll take care of most peoples booking needs. So sign up for the [next HackWimbledon](https://lu.ma/5yj4v8q0) on the 22nd.

Or if you are more up to learn about microcontrollers in an introductory nature, there's MakeMitcham on 14th September at Mitcham Library.
