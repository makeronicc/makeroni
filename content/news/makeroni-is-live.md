Now you may wonder what Makeroni is, so here's some brief history. HackWimbledon, the popup makerspace in Wimbledon, operating out of Wimbletech, has been going for a six years or so when Covid-19 struck.

This made things hard - the group was all about meeting up in person. HackWimbledon adjourned to an online presence with the aim on maybe meeting up again when this thing was over. It's now July, Covid-19 will be with us for quite a while and HackWimbledon had to evolve to meet the new challenge of how to be a community. And the first thing to do was to start closing down HackWimbledon and making a new online space, Makeroni.

## What is Makeroni?

Makeroni is starting out in a prototype phase. Our realtime web presence will be over on Discord on the [Makeroni](https://discord.gg/HYYXHSu) server. There we'll have Discord's fine community interaction tools available to us.

Our social media presence will be in Twitter for now as [@Makeronicc](https://twitter.com/MakeroniCC).

We'll continue to meetup online, every Saturday from 12 till 4 (UK local time) on Discord with video and audio in play for folks to talk and show and make, create and illuminate just like HackWimbledon days (bring your own snacks and drinks (fizzy)).

And finally the website, [Makeroni.cc](https://makeroni.cc), where you are right now, will be the base for a community contributed blog, and the launchpad for our longer term plans.

## What will Makeroni be?

Over the coming months, we're going to start building out the web site to enable users to sign up as Makeroni members, complete with a location and as the conditions change, the site will enable groups of local makers (or visiting makers) to meetup and compare notes, hack devices and the like in a Covid-safe environment. So, that's the plan and if you want to join in making it real, welcome aboard.

## What will happen to HackWimbledon?

We're going to ramp that down over the next month or so, wrapping it all up at the start of September. You'll likely see various announcements about the new arrangements and then we'll stop bugging you or you'll have joined in with the Makeroni crew.

More to come over the rest of the year. Make Good Stuff!
