Makeroni's now on Mastodon, the un-Twitter messaging platform as [@makeroni@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@makeroni). This comes after a cracking talk from [Andy Piper](https://macaw.social/@andypiper) about distributed messaging systems - the notes are on the [wiki](https://github.com/makeronicc/.github/wiki/All-about-Mastodon) and the talk served as a great kick off for attendees to move away from the topically controversial site.

~~Also, did you know we are scheduling on Meetup now? No? You'll find all the activity on the [Meetup Makeroni Page](https://www.meetup.com/makeroni/). If you fancy coming along, just sign up and rsvp to a regular meeting.~~ We've moved meeting scheduling to lu.ma. Check out the [meetings](../meetings) page for more.

On this site, new share icons and links have been added to get you zooming around Makeroni world quicker.

So come and meet us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYYXHSu), check out the work over on [Github](https://github.com/makeronicc), follow our [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@makeroni) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/makeronicc) presences and get involved!
