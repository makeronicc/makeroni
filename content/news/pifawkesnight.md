## TLDR; Pi 5 event at HackWimbledon on November 5th

## Read on:

It's a very special HackWimbledon. Pi Fawkes Night (Well afternoon really) will be a festival of Pi 5s on November 5th. We're all kinda excited about the new Pi and not just because it has a power button and a clock now.

We're getting all the HackWimbledon/Makeroni family to gather to show and tell with their new Pi 5 kit. This is of course, modulo some of the kit arriving with folks but we're pretty confident that at least one or two of us will be getting their boosted Pi powers by the 5th.

Anyway, the idea of this meeting will be to show and tell and to compare notes of the first few weeks of general availability, new software and other early adopter fun.

If you want to get a look at a Pi 5 in the flesh, or if you want to hear how its going, come along. If you're getting a Pi 5, come and tell how you're finding yours. Come celebrate Pi Fawkes Night at HackWimbledon!
