Going into 2025, we’re mixing it up a little, to give our regular spaces more of a theme. Introducing HackWimbledon Code and Make.

## Two Themes, one purpose - Code and Make

Code days will have focus on coding, languages, writing, all the things that go into creating software to make things and talking about it with an eye to creating new things, be they physical or virtual.

Make days will have a focus on the physical building of those things, from sensors to motors, from radio to lidar, from wheels to rotors, and talking about designing, with CAD or craft, those things. And always with an eye on the code we might use to bring the creations to life.

So, two different focuses, but everyone, maker, coder, beginner builder, or expert hacker is welcome, because both focuses are complementary.

We’ll be looking to put together talks for each type of day which build on the days theme. So it could be an introduction to a language on a code day or how to make the most of servos on a make day.

As a rule of thumb, the first HackWimbledon of the month will be the Code day, and the second HackWimbledon of the month will be the Make day.
