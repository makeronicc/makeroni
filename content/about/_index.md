## What is Makeroni?

Makeroni is an umbrella organisation for small popup makerspaces - namely [HackWimbledon](https://hackwimbledon.org/) (for all makers).

We have [physical meetings](/meetings/). HackWimbledon's happen twice a month, *approximately* on the first and third Sunday of every month at Wimbletech. See the meetings page and signed up on [Makeroni Discord](https://discord.gg/HYYXHSu) to be kept up-to-date and to take part in online events.

Our social media presence is in the Fediverse with [Makeroni@mastodon.org.uk](https://mastodon.org.uk/@makeroni).

And finally the website, [Makeroni.cc](https://makeroni.cc), where you are right now, will be the base for a community contributed blog, and a launchpad for our longer term plans.

## What was the original Makeroni plan?

The long term plan was that we're going to build out the website to enable users to sign up as Makeroni members, complete with a location. As conditions changed, the site would enable groups of local makers (or visiting makers) to meetup and compare notes, hack devices and the like in a safe environment. So, that's was the plan and we're still up to implement it at some point so if you want to join in making it real, welcome aboard!

## Want to make your own Makeroni event?

We're always looking to work with anyone who likes the idea of a small popup hackspace. Happy to help if you're looking to do that and happy to partner up
if you want to be under the Makeroni banner. Drop us a [mail](mailto:makeronicc@gmail.com) to find out more.
